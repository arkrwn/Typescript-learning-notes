## Arithmetic Operators##

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on variables or values.

## Addition (+)

```
let x: number = 10;
let y: number = 5;
let sum: number = x + y;   ## sum will be 15
```

Description: The addition operator (+) adds two operands.

Explanation: In this example, `x` is assigned the value `10`, `y` is assigned the value `5`, and `sum` is assigned the sum of `x` and `y`, which is `15`.

## Subtraction (-)

```
let difference: number = x - y;  ## difference will be 5
```

Description: The subtraction operator (-) subtracts the right operand from the left operand.

Explanation: In this example, `difference` is assigned the difference of `x` and `y`, which is `5`.

## Multiplication (\*)

```
let product: number = x * y;    ## product will be 50
```

Description: The multiplication operator (\*) multiplies two operands.

Explanation: In this example, `product` is assigned the product of `x` and `y`, which is `50`.

## Division (/)

```
let quotient: number = x / y;   ## quotient will be 2
```

Description: The division operator (/) divides the left operand by the right operand.

Explanation: In this example, `quotient` is assigned the quotient of dividing `x` by `y`, which is `2`.

## Modulus (Remainder) (%)

```
let remainder: number = x % y;  ## remainder will be 0
```

Description: The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of dividing the left operand by the right operand.

Explanation: In this example, `remainder` is assigned the remainder of dividing `x` by `y`, which is `0`.

## Exponentiation (\*\*)

```
let power: number = x ** 2;     ## power will be 100 (10 raised to the power of 2)
```

Description: The exponentiation operator (\*\*) raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.

Explanation: In this example, `power` is assigned the result of raising `x` to the power of `2`, which is `100`.

## Increment (++)

```
let num: number = 5;
num++;   ## num will be 6
```

Description: The increment operator (++) increases the value of the operand by 1.

Explanation: In this example, `num` is incremented by 1, so its value becomes `6`.

## Decrement (--)

```
num--;   ## num will be 5 again
```

Description: The decrement operator (--) decreases the value of the operand by 1.

Explanation: In this example, `num` is decremented by 1, so its value returns to `5`.

### Key Points:

- Arithmetic operators in TypeScript perform common mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, increment, and decrement.
- These operators can be applied to variables of numeric types, such as number or bigint, to perform mathematical calculations.
- Understanding arithmetic operators is fundamental for performing calculations and manipulating numeric data in TypeScript programs.
